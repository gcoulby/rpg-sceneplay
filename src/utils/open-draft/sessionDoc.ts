/**
 * The open document, held across a route change.
 *
 * Settings, the project list and the plugin routes are separate routes, so
 * leaving the editor unmounts ScreenplayEditor and destroys the ProseMirror
 * document with it. A script opened from a `/project/:id/edit/:scriptId` URL is
 * refetched on the way back, but every other way of opening one leaves the URL
 * at `/`:
 *
 *   - File → Open, which sets the project/script in the store and never
 *     navigates
 *   - a file imported from disk, which has no library record at all
 *   - a new screenplay that was never saved
 *
 * Those came back blank. This module keeps the last document in memory (never
 * on disk — that is what backups and the library are for) so the editor can put
 * it back exactly as the writer left it.
 *
 * The stash is identified by project + script id, and reading it consumes it,
 * so a document can never be restored into a context it did not come from.
