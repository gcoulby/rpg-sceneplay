 * Returns true when a ProseMirror doc/JSON contains any non-whitespace text
 * anywhere in its body. An editor that was reset to its empty default (e.g. on
 * a re-mount before content reloads) serializes to a textless body, and we must
 * never let that overwrite a saved screenplay.
 *
 * Only `content` arrays are walked, so app-metadata keys carried alongside the
 * doc (e.g. `_notes`, `_tagCategories`) do NOT count as body text.
 *
 * Used by both the editor's auto-save guards (ScreenplayEditor.tsx) and the
 * storage-layer guard (local-storage.ts). Kept free of any framework/Tauri
 * imports so it is trivially unit-testable.
